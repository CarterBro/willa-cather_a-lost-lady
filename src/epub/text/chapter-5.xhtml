 <p>
 Niel went up the hill the next afternoon, just as the cutter with the
 two black ponies jingled round the driveway and stopped at the front
 door. Mrs. Forrester came out on the porch, dressed for a sleigh ride.
 Ellinger followed her, buttoned up in a long fur-lined coat, showily
 befrogged down the front, with a glossy astrachan collar. He looked even
 more powerful and bursting with vigour than last night. His
 highly-coloured, well-visored countenance shone with a good opinion of
 himself and of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
 Mrs. Forrester called to Niel gaily. “We are going down to the Sweet
 Water to cut cedar boughs for Christmas. Will you keep Constance
 company? She seems a trifle disappointed at being left behind, but we
 can’t take the big sleigh⁠—the pole is broken. Be nice to her, there’s a
 good boy!” She pressed his hand, gave him a meaning, confidential smile,
 and stepped into the sleigh. Ellinger sprang in beside her, and they
 glided down the hill with a merry tinkle of sleighbells.
 </p>
 <p>
 Niel found Miss Ogden in the back parlour, playing solitaire by the
 fire. She was clearly out of humour.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Come in, Mr. Herbert. I think they might have taken us along, don’t
 you? I want to see the river my own self. I hate bein’ shut up in the
 house!”
 </p>
 <p>“Let’s go out, then. Wouldn’t you like to see the town?”</p>
 <p>
 Constance seemed not to hear him. She was wrinkling and unwrinkling her
 short nose, and the restless lines about her mouth were fluttering.
 “What’s to hinder us from getting a sleigh at the livery barn and going
 down to the Sweet Water? I don’t suppose the river’s private property?”
 She gave a nervous, angry laugh and looked hopefully at Niel.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We couldn’t get anything at this hour. The livery teams are all out,”
 he said with firmness.
 </p>
 <p>
 Constance glanced at him suspiciously, then sat down at the card table
 and leaned over it, drawing her plump shoulders together. Her fluffy
 yellow hair was wound round her head like a scarf and held in place by
 narrow bands of black velvet.
 </p>
 <p>
 The ponies had crossed the second creek and were trotting down the high
 road toward the river. Mrs. Forrester expressed her feelings in a laugh
 full of mischief. “Is she running after us? Where did she get the idea
 that she was to come? What a relief to get away!” She lifted her chin
 and sniffed the air. The day was grey, without sun, and the air was
 still and dry, a warm cold. “Poor Mr. Ogden,” she went on, “how much
 livelier he is without his ladies! They almost extinguish him. Now
 aren’t you glad you never married?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I’m certainly glad I never married a homely woman. What does a man do
 it for, anyway? She had no money⁠—and he’s always had it, or been on the
 way to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, they’re off tomorrow. And Connie! You’ve reduced her to a state
 of imbecility, really! What an afternoon Niel must be having!” She
 laughed as if the idea of his predicament delighted her.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Who’s this kid, anyway?” Ellinger asked her to take the reins for a
 moment while he drew a cigar from his pocket. “He’s a trifle stiff. Does
 he make himself useful?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Oh, he’s a nice boy, stranded here like the rest of us. I’m going to
 train him to be very useful. He’s devoted to Mr. Forrester. Handsome,
 don’t you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “So-so.” They turned into a by-road that wound along the Sweet Water.
 Ellinger held the ponies in a little and turned down his high astrachan
 collar. “Let’s have a look at you, Marian.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Mrs. Forrester was holding her muff before her face, to catch the flying
 particles of snow the ponies kicked up. From behind it she glanced at
 him sidewise. “Well?” she said teasingly.
 </p>
 <p>
 He put his arm through hers and settled himself low in the sleigh. “You
 ought to look at me better than that. It’s been a devil of a long while
 since I’ve seen you.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Perhaps it’s been too long,” she murmured. The mocking spark in her
 eyes softened perceptibly under the long pressure of his arm. “Yes, it’s
 been long,” she admitted lightly.
 </p>
 <p>“You didn’t answer the letter I wrote you on the eleventh.”</p>
 <p>
 “Didn’t I? Well, at any rate I answered your telegram.” She drew her
 head away as his face came nearer. “You’ll really have to watch the
 ponies, my dear, or they’ll tumble us out in the snow.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I don’t care. I wish they would!” he said between his teeth. “Why
 didn’t you answer my letter?”
 </p>
 <p>“Oh, I don’t remember! You don’t write so many.”</p>
 <p>
 “It’s no satisfaction. You won’t let me write you love letters. You say
 it’s risky.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “So it is, and foolish. But now you needn’t be so careful. Not too
 careful!” she laughed softly. “When I’m off in the country for a whole
 winter, alone, and growing older, I like to⁠ ⁠…” she put her hand on
 his, “to be reminded of pleasanter things.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Ellinger took off his glove with his teeth. His eyes, sweeping the
 winding road and the low, snow-covered bluffs, had something wolfish in
 them.
 </p>
 <p>“Be careful, Frank. My rings! You hurt me!”</p>
 <p>
 “Then why didn’t you take them off? You used to. Are these your cedars,
 shall we stop here?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “No, not here.” She spoke very low. “The best ones are farther on, in a
 deep ravine that winds back into the hills.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Ellinger glanced at her averted head, and his heavy lips twitched in a
 smile at one corner. The quality of her voice had changed, and he knew
 the change. They went spinning along the curves of the winding road,
 saying not a word. Mrs. Forrester sat with her head bent forward, her
 face half hidden in her muff. At last she told him to stop. To the right
 of the road he saw a thicket. Behind it a dry watercourse wound into the
 bluffs. The tops of the dark, still cedars, just visible from the road,
 indicated its windings.
 </p>
 <p>“Sit still,” he said, “while I take out the horses.”</p>
 <p>
 <br />
 </p>
 <p>
 When the blue shadows of approaching dusk were beginning to fall over
 the snow, one of the Blum boys, slipping quietly along through the
 timber in search of rabbits, came upon the empty cutter standing in the
 brush, and near it the two ponies, stamping impatiently where they were
 tied. Adolph slid bade into the thicket and lay down behind a fallen log
 to see what would happen. Not much ever happened to him but weather.
 </p>
 <p>
 Presently he heard low voices, coming nearer from the ravine. The big
 stranger who was visiting at the Forresters’ emerged, carrying the
 buffalo robes on one arm; Mrs. Forrester herself was clinging to the
 other. They walked slowly, wholly absorbed by what they were saying to
 each other. When they came up to the sleigh, the man spread the robes on
 the seat and put his hands under Mrs. Forrester’s arms to lift her in.
 But he did not lift her; he stood for a long while holding her crushed
 up against his breast, her face hidden in his black overcoat.
 </p>
 <p>
 “What about those damned cedar boughs?” he asked, after he had put her
 in and covered her up. “Shall I go back and cut some?”
 </p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter,” she murmured.</p>
 <p>
 He reached under the seat for a hatchet and went back to the ravine.
 Mrs. Forrester sat with her eyes closed, her cheek pillowed on her muff,
 a faint, soft smile on her lips. The air was still and blue; the Blum
 boy could almost hear her breathe. When the strokes of the hatchet rang
 out from the ravine, he could see her eyelids flutter⁠ ⁠… soft shivers
 went through her body.
 </p>
 <p>
 The man came back and threw the evergreens into the sleigh. When he got
 in beside her, she slipped her hand through his arm and settled softly
 against him. “Drive slowly,” she murmured, as if she were talking in her
 sleep. “It doesn’t matter if we are late for dinner. Nothing matters.”
 The ponies trotted off.
 </p>
 <p>
 The pale Blum boy rose from behind his log and followed the tracks up
 the ravine. When the orange moon rose over the bluffs, he was still
 sitting under the cedars, his gun on his knee. While Mrs. Forrester had
 been waiting there in the sleigh, with her eyes closed, feeling so safe,
 he could almost have touched her with his hand. He had never seen her
 before when her mocking eyes and lively manner were not between her and
 all the world. If it had been Thad Grimes who lay behind that log, now,
 or Ivy Peters?
 </p>
 <p>
 But with Adolph Blum her secrets were safe. His mind was feudal; the
 rich and fortunate were also the privileged. These warm-blooded,
 quick-breathing people took chances⁠—followed impulses only dimly
 understandable to a boy who was wet and weather-chapped all the year;
 who waded in the mud fishing for cat, or lay in the marsh waiting for
 wild duck. Mrs. Forrester had never been too haughty to smile at him
 when he came to the back door with his fish. She never haggled about the
 price. She treated him like a human being. His little chats with her,
 her nod and smile when she passed him on the street, were among the
 pleasantest things he had to remember. She bought game of him in the
 closed season, and didn’t give him away.
