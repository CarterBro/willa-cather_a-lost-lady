      <p>
        Niel had planned to do a great deal of reading in the Forresters’ grove
        that summer, but he did not go over so often as he had intended. The
        frequent appearance of Ivy Peters about the place irritated him. Ivy
        visited his new wheat fields on the bottom land very often; and he
        always took the old path, that led from what was once the marsh, up the
        steep bank and through the grove. He was likely to appear at any hour,
        his trousers stuffed into his top-boots, tramping along between the rows
        of trees with an air of proprietorship. He shut the gate behind the
        house with a slam and went whistling through the yard. Often he stopped
        at the kitchen door to call out some pleasantry to
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester. This annoyed Niel, for at that hour of the
        morning, when she was doing her housework, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester
        was not dressed to receive her inferiors. It was one thing to greet the
        president of the Colorado &amp; Utah en déshabille, but it was another
        to chatter with a coarse-grained fellow like Ivy Peters in her wrapper
        and slippers, her sleeves rolled up and her throat bare to his cool,
        impudent eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes Ivy strode through the rose plot where Captain Forrester was
        sitting in the sun⁠—went by without looking at him, as if there were no
        one there. If he spoke to the Captain at all, he did so as if he were
        addressing someone incapable of understanding anything. “Hullo, Captain,
        ain’t afraid this sun will spoil your complexion?” or “Well, Captain,
        you’ll have to get the prayer-meetings to take up this rain question.
        The drought’s damned bad for my wheat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        One morning, as Niel was coming up through the grove, he heard laughter
        by the gate, and there he saw Ivy, with his gun, talking to
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester. She was bareheaded, her skirts blowing in
        the wind, her arm through the handle of a big tin bucket that rested on
        the fence beside her. Ivy stood with his hat on his head, but there was
        in his attitude that unmistakable something which shows that a man is
        trying to make himself agreeable to a woman. He was telling her a funny
        story, probably an improper one, for it brought out her naughtiest
        laugh, with something nervous and excited in it, as if he were going too
        far. At the end of his story Ivy himself broke into his farmhand
        guffaw. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester shook her finger at him and,
        catching up her pail, ran back into the house. She bent a little with
        its weight, but Ivy made no offer to carry it for her. He let her trip
        away with it as if she were a kitchen maid, and that were her business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Niel emerged from the grove, and stopped where the Captain sat in the
        garden. “Good morning, Captain Forrester. Was that Ivy Peters who just
        went through here? That fellow hasn’t the manners of a pig!” he blurted
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Captain pointed to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester’s empty chair. “Sit
        down, Niel, sit down.” He drew his handkerchief from his pocket and
        began polishing his glasses. “No,” he said quietly, “he ain’t overly
        polite.”
      </p>
      <p>
        More than if he had complained bitterly, that guarded admission made one
        feel how much he had been hurt and offended by Ivy’s rudeness. There was
        something very sad in his voice, and helpless. From his equals, respect
        had always come to him as his due; from fellows like Ivy he had been
        able to command it⁠—to order them off his place, or dismiss them from
        his employ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Niel sat down and smoked a cigar with him. They had a long talk about
        the building of the Black Hills branch of the Burlington. In Boston last
        winter Niel had met an old mine-owner, who was living in Deadwood when
        the railroad first came in. When Niel asked him if he had known Daniel
        Forrester, the old gentleman said, “Forrester? Was he the one with the
        beautiful wife?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You must tell her,” said the Captain, stroking the warm surface of his
        sundial. “Yes, indeed. You must tell <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        One night in the first week of July, a night of glorious moonlight, Niel
        found himself unable to read, or to stay indoors at all. He walked
        aimlessly down the wide, empty street, and crossed the first creek by
        the footbridge. The wide ripe fields, the whole country, seemed like a
        sleeping garden. One trod the dusty roads softly, not to disturb the
        deep slumber of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Forrester lane the scent of sweet clover hung heavy. It had
        always grown tall and green here ever since Niel could remember; the
        Captain would never let it be cut until the weeds were mowed in the
        fall. The black, plume-like shadows of the poplars fell across the lane
        and over Ivy Peters’ wheat fields. As he walked on, Niel saw a white
        figure standing on the bridge over the second creek, motionless in the
        clear moonlight. He hurried forward. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester was
        looking down at the water where it flowed bright over the pebbles. He
        came up beside her. “The Captain is asleep?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, yes, long ago! He sleeps well, thank heaven! After I tuck him in, I
        have nothing more to worry about.”
      </p>
      <p>
        While they were standing there, talking in low voices, they heard a
        heavy door slam on the hill. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester started and
        looked back over her shoulder. A man emerged from the shadow of the
        house and came striding down the driveway. Ivy Peters stepped upon the
        bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Good evening,” he said to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester, neither calling
        her by name nor removing his hat. “I see you have company. I’ve just
        been up looking at the old barn, to see if the stalls are fit to put
        horses in there tomorrow. I’m going to start cutting wheat in the
        morning, and we’ll have to put the horses in your stable at noon. We’d
        lose time taking them back to town.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why, certainly. The horses can go in our barn. I’m sure
        <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrester would have no objection.” She spoke as if he
        had asked her permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh!” Ivy shrugged. “The men will begin down here at six o’clock. I
        won’t get over till about ten, and I have to meet a client at my office
        at three. Maybe you could give me some lunch, to save time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        His impudence made her smile. “Very well, then; I invite you to lunch.
        We lunch at one.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thanks. It will help me out.” As if he had forgotten himself, he lifted
        his hat, and went down the lane swinging it in his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Niel stood looking after him. “Why do you allow him to speak to you like
        that, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester? If you’ll let me, I’ll give him a
        beating and teach him how to speak to you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, no, Niel! Remember, we have to get along with Ivy Peters, we simply
        have to!” There was a note of anxiety in her voice, and she caught his
        arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You don’t have to take anything from him, or to stand his bad manners.
        Anybody else would pay you as much for the land as he does.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “But he has a lease for five years, and he could make it very
        disagreeable for us, don’t you see? Besides,” she spoke hurriedly,
        “there’s more than that. He’s invested a little money for me in Wyoming,
        in land. He gets splendid land from the Indians some way, for next to
        nothing. Don’t tell your uncle; I’ve no doubt it’s crooked. But the
        Judge is like <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrester; his methods don’t work
        nowadays. He will never get us out of debt, dear man! He can’t get
        himself out. Ivy Peters is terribly smart, you know. He owns half the
        town already.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not quite,” said Niel grimly. “He’s got hold of a good deal of
        property. He’ll take advantage of anybody’s necessity. You know he’s
        utterly unscrupulous, don’t you? Why didn’t you let
        <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dalzell, or some of your other old friends, invest your
        money for you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, it was too little! Only a few hundred dollars I’d saved on the
        housekeeping. They would put it into something safe, at six per cent. I
        know you don’t like Ivy⁠—and he knows it! He’s always at his worst
        before you. He’s not so bad as⁠—as his face, for instance!” She laughed
        nervously. “He honestly wants to help us out of the hole we’re in.
        Coming and going all the time, as he does, he sees everything, and I
        really think he hates to have me work so hard.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Next time you have anything to invest, you let me take it to
        <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dalzell and explain. I’ll promise to do as well by you
        as Ivy Peters can.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester took his arm and drew him into the lane.
        “But, my dear boy, you know nothing about these business schemes. You’re
        not clever that way⁠—it’s one of the things I love you for. I don’t
        admire people who cheat Indians. Indeed I don’t!” She shook her head
        vehemently.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester, rascality isn’t the only thing that
        succeeds in business.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It succeeds faster than anything else, though,” she murmured absently.
        They walked as far as the end of the lane and turned back again.
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester’s hand tightened on his arm. She began
        speaking abruptly. “You see, two years, three years, more of this, and I
        could still go back to California⁠—and live again. But after that⁠ ⁠…
        Perhaps people think I’ve settled down to grow old gracefully, but I’ve
        not. I feel such a power to live in me, Niel.” Her slender fingers
        gripped his wrist. “It’s grown by being held back. Last winter I was
        with the Dalzells at Glenwood Springs for three weeks (I owe
        <em>that</em> to Ivy Peters; he looked after things here, and his sister
        kept house for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrester), and I was surprised at
        myself. I could dance all night and not feel tired. I could ride
        horseback all day and be ready for a dinner party in the evening. I had
        no clothes, of course; old evening dresses with yards and yards of satin
        and velvet in them, that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dalzell’s sewing woman made
        over. But I looked well enough! Yes, I did. I always know how I’m
        looking, and I looked well enough. The men thought so. I looked happier
        than any woman there. They were nearly all younger, much. But they
        seemed dull, bored to death. After a glass or two of champagne they went
        to sleep and had nothing to say! I always look better after the first
        glass⁠—it gives me a little colour, it’s the only thing that does. I
        accepted the Dalzell’s invitation with a purpose; I wanted to see
        whether I had anything left worth saving. And I have, I tell you! You
        would hardly believe it, I could hardly believe it, but I still have!”
      </p>
      <p>
        By this time they had reached the bridge, a bare white floor in the
        moonlight. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester had been quickening her pace all
        the while. “So that’s what I’m struggling for, to get out of this
        hole,”⁠—she looked about as if she had fallen into a deep well⁠—“out of
        it! When I’m alone here for months together, I plan and plot. If it
        weren’t for that⁠—”
      </p>
      <p>
        As Niel walked back to his room behind the law offices, he felt
        frightened for her. When women began to talk about still feeling young,
        didn’t it mean that something had broken? Two or three years, she said.
        He shivered. Only yesterday old <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Dennison had proudly
        told him that Captain Forrester might live a dozen. “We are keeping his
        general health up remarkably, and he was originally a man of iron.”
      </p>
      <p>
        What hope was there for her? He could still feel her hand upon his arm,
        as she urged him faster and faster up the lane.
