      <p>
        One morning when a warm May wind was whirling the dust up the street,
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester came smiling into Judge Pommeroy’s office,
        wearing a new spring bonnet, and a short black velvet cape, fastened at
        the neck with a bunch of violets. “Please be nice enough to notice my
        new clothes, Niel,” she said coaxingly. “They are the first I’ve had in
        years and years.”
      </p>
      <p>He told her they were very pretty.</p>
      <p>
        “And aren’t you glad I have some at last?” she smiled enquiringly
        through her veil. “I feel as if you weren’t going to be cross with me
        today, and would do what I ask you. It’s nothing very troublesome. I
        want you to come to dinner Friday night. If you come, there will be
        eight of us, counting Annie Peters. They are all boys you know, and if
        you don’t like them, you ought to! Yes, you ought to!” she nodded at him
        severely. “Since you mind what people say, Niel, aren’t you afraid
        they’ll be saying you’re a snob, just because you’ve been to Boston and
        seen a little of the world? You mustn’t be so stiff, so⁠—so superior! It
        isn’t becoming, at your age.” She drew her brows down into a level frown
        so like his own that he laughed. He had almost forgotten her old talent
        for mimicry.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What do you want me for? You used always to say it was no good asking
        people who didn’t mix.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You can mix well enough, if you take the trouble. And this time you
        will, for me. Won’t you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        When she was gone, Niel was angry with himself for having been
        persuaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday evening he was the last guest to arrive. It was a warm night,
        after a hot day. The windows were open, and the perfume of the lilacs
        came into the dusky parlour where the boys were sitting about in chairs
        that seemed too big for them. A lamp was burning in the dining-room, and
        there Ivy Peters stood at the sideboard, mixing cocktails. His sister
        Annie was in the kitchen, helping the hostess.
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester came in for a moment to greet Niel, then
        excused herself and hurried back to Annie Peters. Through the open door
        he saw that the silver dishes had reappeared on the dinner table, and
        the candlesticks and flowers. The young men who sat about in the
        twilight would not know the difference, he thought, if she had furnished
        her table that morning, from the stock in Wernz’s queensware store.
        Their conception of a really fine dinner service was one “hand painted”
        by a sister or sweetheart. Each boy sat with his legs crossed, one tan
        shoe swinging in the air and displaying a tan silk sock. They were
        talking about clothes; Joe Simpson, who had just inherited his father’s
        clothing business, was eager to tell them what the summer styles would
        be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ivy Peters came in, shaking his drinks. “You fellows are like a bunch of
        girls⁠—always talking about what you are going to wear and how you can
        spend your money. Simpson wouldn’t get rich very fast if you all wore
        your clothes as long as I do. When did I get this suit, Joe?”
      </p>
      <p>“Oh, about the year I graduated from High School, I guess!”</p>
      <p>
        They all laughed at Ivy. No matter what he did or said, they laughed⁠—in
        recognition of his general success.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester came back, fanning herself with a little
        sandalwood fan, and when she appeared the boys rose⁠—in alarm, one might
        have thought, from the suddenness of it. That much, at any rate, she had
        succeeded in teaching them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Are your cocktails ready, Ivy? You will have to wait for me a moment,
        while I put some powder on my nose. If I’d known how hot it would be
        tonight, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have had a roast for you. I’m browner
        than the ducks. You can pour them though. I won’t be long.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She disappeared into her own room, and the boys sat down with the same
        surprising promptness. Ivy Peters carried the tray about, and they held
        their glasses before them, waiting for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester. When
        she came, she took Niel’s arm and led him into the dining-room. “Did you
        notice,” she whispered to him, “how they hold their glasses? What is it
        they do to a little glass to make it look so vulgar? Nobody could ever
        teach them to pick one up and drink out of it, not if there were tea in
        it!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Aloud she said, “Niel, will you light the candles for me? And then take
        the head of the table, please. You can carve ducks?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not so well as⁠—as my uncle does,” he murmured, carefully putting back
        a candle-shade.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nor as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrester did? I don’t ask that. Nobody can
        carve now as men used to. But you can get them apart, I suppose? The
        place at your right is for Annie Peters. She is bringing in the dinner
        for me. Be seated, gentlemen!” with a little mocking bow and a swinging
        of earrings.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Niel was carving the ducks, Annie slipped into the chair beside
        him, her naturally red face glowing from the heat of the stove. She was
        several years younger than her brother, whom she obeyed unquestioningly
        in everything. She had an extremely bad complexion and pale yellow hair
        with white lights in it, exactly the colour of molasses taffy that has
        been pulled until it glistens. During the dinner she did not once speak,
        except to say, “Thank you,” or “No, thank you.” Nobody but
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester talked much until the first helping of duck
        was consumed. The boys had not yet learned to do two things at once.
        They paused only to ask their hostess if she “would care for the jelly,”
        or to answer her questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Niel studied <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester between the candles, as she
        nodded encouragingly to one and another, trying to “draw them out,”
        laughing at Roy Jones’ heavy jokes, or congratulating Joe Simpson upon
        his new dignity as a business man with a business of his own. The long
        earrings swung beside the thin cheeks that were none the better, he
        thought, for the rouge she had put on them when she went to her room
        just before dinner. It improved some women, but not her⁠—at least, not
        tonight, when her eyes were hollow with fatigue, and she looked pinched
        and worn as he had never seen her. He sighed as he thought how much work
        it meant to cook a dinner like this for eight people⁠—and a beefsteak
        with potatoes would have pleased them better! They didn’t really like
        this kind of food at all. Why did she do it? How would she feel about it
        tonight, when she sank dead weary into bed, after these stupid boys had
        said good night, and their yellow shoes had carried them down the hill?
      </p>
      <p>
        She was not eating anything, she was using up all her vitality to
        electrify these heavy lads into speech. Niel felt that he must help her,
        or at least try to. He addressed them one after another with energy and
        determination; he tried baseball, politics, scandal, the corn crop. They
        answered him with monosyllables or exclamations. He soon realized that
        they didn’t want his polite remarks; they wanted more duck, and to be
        let alone with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dinner was soon over, at any rate. The hostess’ attempts to prolong it
        were unavailing. The salad and frozen pudding were dispatched as
        promptly as the roast had been. The guests went into the parlour and lit
        cigars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester had the old-fashioned notion that men should
        be alone after dinner. She did not join them for half an hour. Perhaps
        she had lain down upstairs, for she looked a little rested. The boys
        were talking now, discussing a camping trip Ed Elliot was going to take
        in the mountains. They were giving him advice about camp outfits, trout
        flies, mixtures to keep off mosquitoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ll tell you, boys,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester, when she had
        listened to them for a moment, “when I go back to California, I intend
        to have a summer cabin up in the Sierras, and I invite you, one and all,
        to visit me. You’ll have to work for your keep, you understand; cut the
        firewood and bring the water and wash the pots and pans, and go out and
        catch fish for breakfast. Ivy can bring his gun and shoot game for us,
        and I’ll bake bread in an iron pot, the old trappers’ way, if I haven’t
        forgotten how. Will you come?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You bet we will! You know those mountains by heart, I expect?” said Ed
        Elliot.
      </p>
      <p>
        She smiled and shook her head. “It would take a lifetime to do that, Ed,
        more than a lifetime. The Sierras⁠—there’s no end to them, and they’re
        magnificent.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Niel turned to her. “Have you ever told the boys how it was you first
        met Captain Forrester in the mountains out there? If they haven’t heard
        the story, I think they would like it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Really, would you? Well, once upon a time, when I was a very young
        girl, I was spending the summer at a camp in the mountains, with friends
        of my father’s.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She began there, but that was not the beginning of the story; long ago
        Niel had heard from his uncle that the beginning was a scandal and a
        murder. When Marian Ormsby was nineteen, she was engaged to Ned
        Montgomery, a gaudy young millionaire of the Gold Coast. A few weeks
        before the date set for their marriage, Montgomery was shot and killed
        in the lobby of a San Francisco hotel by the husband of another woman.
        The subsequent trial involved a great deal of publicity, and Marian was
        hurried away from curious eyes and sent up into the mountains until the
        affair should blow over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrester began with “Once upon a time.”
        Sitting at one end of the big sofa, her slippers on a footstool and her
        head in shadow, she stirred the air before her face with the sandalwood
        fan as she talked, the rings glittering on her white fingers. She told
        them how Captain Forrester, then a widower, had come up to the camp to
        visit her father’s partner. She had noticed him very little⁠—she was off
        every day with the young men. One afternoon she had persuaded young Fred
        Harney, an intrepid mountain climber, to take her down the face of Eagle
        Cliff. They were almost down, and were creeping over a projecting ledge,
        when the rope broke, and they dropped to the bottom. Harney fell on the
        rocks and was killed instantly. The girl was caught in a pine tree,
        which arrested her fall. Both her legs were broken, and she lay in the
        canyon all night in the bitter cold, swept by the icy canyon draught.
        Nobody at the camp knew where to look for the two missing members of the
        party⁠—they had stolen off alone for their foolhardy adventure. Nobody
        worried, because Harney knew all the trails and could not get lost. In
        the morning, however, when they were still missing, search parties went
        out. It was Captain Forrester’s party that found Marian, and got her out
        by the lower trail. The trail was so steep and narrow, the turns round
        the jutting ledges so sharp, that it was impossible to take her out on a
        litter. The men took turns carrying her, hugging the canyon walls with
        their shoulders as they crept along. With her broken legs hanging, she
        suffered terribly⁠—fainted again and again. But she noticed that she
        suffered less when Captain Forrester carried her, and that he took all
        the most dangerous places on the trail himself. “I could feel his heart
        pump and his muscles strain,” she said, “when he balanced himself and me
        on the rocks. I knew that if we fell, we’d go together; he would never
        drop me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They got back to camp, and everything possible was done for her, but by
        the time a surgeon could be got up from San Francisco, her fractures had
        begun to knit and had to be broken over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was Captain Forrester I wanted to hold my hand when the surgeon had
        to do things to me. You remember, Niel, he always boasted that I never
        screamed when they were carrying me up the trail. He stayed at the camp
        until I could begin to walk, holding to his arm. When he asked me to
        marry him, he didn’t have to ask twice. Do you wonder?” She looked with
        a smile about the circle, and drew her fingertips absently across her
        forehead as if to brush away something⁠—the past, or the present, who
        could tell?
      </p>
      <p>
        The boys were genuinely moved. While she was answering their questions,
        Niel thought about the first time he ever heard her tell that story:
        <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dalzell had stopped off with a party of friends from
        Chicago; Marshall Field and the president of the Union Pacific were
        among them, he remembered, and they were going through in
        <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dalzell’s private car to hunt in the Black Hills. She
        had, after all, not changed so much since then. Niel felt tonight that
        the right man could save her, even now. She was still her indomitable
        self, going through her old part⁠—but only the stagehands were left to
        listen to her. All those who had shared in fine undertakings and bright
        occasions were gone.
